**Overview**
An app that lets a group of friends decide where to eat. An initial user - from a pool of options - creates an interactive form, which is then sent to friends. Friends answer questions/enter different types of preferences and then are put into a chatroom with the rest of the group. Then the app, based upon factors such as distance, ambiance, reputability, size, cuisine style and etc, creates an aesthetically pleasing list of rankings. 

**Problem:**
This app will help people explore different cuisines and places to eat. It will save time while deciding where to have their meals because it will do the deciding for them. This will be especially helpful when multiple people want to share a meal because it will align their interests.
