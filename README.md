**Overview**
An app that lets a group of friends decide where to eat. An initial user - from a pool of options - creates an interactive form, which is then sent to friends. Friends answer questions/enter different types of preferences and then are put into a chatroom with the rest of the group. Then the app, based upon factors such as distance, price, dietary restrictions, cuisine, etc, creates an aesthetically pleasing list of rankings. Suggestions are displayed along with a map that shows current location and location of all restaurants as well as a route to the highest rated restaurant. Users can chat, and alter ordering of restaurants by price/distance. They can also upvote/downvote restaurants and sort according to number of votes. They can remove an suggestion from the list and have it replaced by a new one. 

**Problem:**
This app will help people explore different cuisines and places to eat. It will save time while deciding where to have their meals because it will do the deciding for them. This will be especially helpful when multiple people want to share a meal because it will align their interests/preferences.
